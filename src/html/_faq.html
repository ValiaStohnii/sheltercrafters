          What is modular construction?
        </summary>

        <div>
          <p>
            Modular construction is a method of building structures off-site in a controlled environment, then transporting and assembling them on-site. It involves constructing individual modules or sections in a factory setting before they are transported to the construction site for assembly.

          Do modular structures require permits and inspections?
        </summary>

        <div>
          <p>
            Yes, like any construction project, modular structures typically require permits and inspections to ensure compliance with local building codes and regulations. Our team can assist clients in obtaining the necessary permits and coordinate inspections as part of the project management process.

          How does the cost of modular construction compare to traditional construction methods?
        </summary>

        <div>
          <p>
            While the initial upfront costs of modular construction may be comparable to or slightly higher than traditional construction methods, the overall cost savings can be significant due to shorter construction timelines, reduced labor costs, and minimized disruptions to surrounding areas. Additionally, the efficiency and sustainability of modular construction can lead to long-term cost savings in terms of energy consumption and maintenance.
